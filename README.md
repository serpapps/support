Welcome

This is the official area for [SERP](https://serp.co/) software product releases with a dedicated repository for each of our applications.

Each product has it's own [repository](https://github.com/orgs/serpapps/repositories) for:

1. **ISSUES**: Submit application specific problems, bugs, issues in the `/issues` area of the relevant application's repository.
2. **RELEASES**: Download the latest version of the application or access previous releases and pre-releases in the repository's `/releases` area.
3. [**DISCUSSIONS**](https://github.com/orgs/serpapps/discussions): This is the "help center" where you'll find answers to FAQs and help articles
4. [**PROJECTS**](https://github.com/orgs/serpapps/projects): Follow along with development progress, view roadmaps and see what features are currently being worked on.
5. **SUPPORT**: If you need general help, you can hop on [chat support here] (bottom right)(https://serpcompany.tawk.help/) or [submit a ticket here (top menu bar)](https://serpcompany.tawk.help/)
We also have a free community called [SERP University](https://serp.ly/@serp/community) you can join to connect with the SERP team, other users, discuss features, share tips, etc. This is not a "support forum" so do not post your support-related questions here.
