Welcome

This is the official area for [SERP](https://serp.co/) software product releases with a dedicated repository for each of our applications.

Each product has it's own [repository](https://github.com/orgs/serpapps/repositories) for:

1. **ISSUES**: Submit application specific problems, bugs, issues in the `/issues` area of the relevant application's repository.
2. **RELEASES**: Download the latest version of the application or access previous releases and pre-releases in the repository's `/releases` area.
3. [**DISCUSSIONS**](https://github.com/orgs/serpapps/discussions): This is the "help center" where you'll find answers to FAQs and help articles
4. [**PROJECTS**](https://github.com/orgs/serpapps/projects): Follow along with development progress, view roadmaps and see what features are currently being worked on.
5. **SUPPORT**: If you need general help, you can submit a [SUPPORT ISSUE](https://github.com/serpapps/support/issues) or you can [hop on SERP Chat directly with this link](https://serp.ly/@serp/support)

We also have a free community called [SERP University](https://serp.ly/@serp/community) you can join to connect with the SERP team, other users, discuss features, share tips, etc. This is not a "support forum" so do not post your support-related questions here.

## about downloaders

There are alot of places online to upload your work, and even more [file formats](https://serptools.github.io/files/) you could publish your creations in.

Many of them have poor user experience for creators and uploaders (even the really really big ones). 

And many of them dissapear after a while. 

As a creator there are too many factors that hinder your ability to save, retreive and backup your content -- even the RAW creation doesnt match the published output sometimes due to metadata, captions, thumbnails, etc.

So part of our effort with SERP Apps is to provide creators a way to quickly and conveniently download and save the various types of content they have uploaded around the web.

We provide tools to make your life on the web easier. To make downloading public content, ideally your content, easier.

We take **zero liability**. the end user is responsible for what they download, how they use and distribute that content.

We don't save or store the content. We don't redistribute the content. 

We are not pirates, this is not a piracy tool. It only interacts with and downloads free & publicly accessible content - same content can be downloaded via dev tools of any modern web browser.

We hope that you will use them to save the content you worked so hard to create, and we do recognize that they could be used for less-than-above-board endeavors... but what couldn't? If we stopped building everything that could be used for a malicious purpose the World (and especially the internet) would be filled with ... nothing.

Use these downloaders on your own content, that you have rights to. 

And be a proprietor of good  buggery... I mean buffoonery!
